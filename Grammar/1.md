### Cargo new

> See link : [How to build a Rust Project](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust#_cargo-new)

A good way to create your first Rust program is to use Cargo to scaffold a new project by typing `cargo new`. This will create a simple Hello World program along with a default `Cargo.tml` dependency file. You pass `cargo new` the folder where you'd like to create the project.

Let's create Hello World. Navigate to a folder where you'd like to create your project and type:

```
cargo new hello_world   ## 在本地某处建一个文件夹hello_world,同时也是一个rust project
```

To open your new project in VS Code, navigate into the new folder and launch VS Code via `code .`:

```
cd hello_world
code .
```

> **Note**: Enable [Workspace Trust](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust) for the new folder as you are the author. You can enable Workspace Trust for your entire project folder parent to avoid being prompted when you create new projects by checking the option to **Trust the authors of all the files in parent folder 'my_projects`**.

`cargo new` creates a simple Hello World project with a `main.rs` source code file and `Cargo.toml` [Cargo manifest](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html) file.

```
src\
    main.rs
.gitignore
Cargo.toml
```

`main.rs` has the program's entry function `main()` and prints "Hello, world!" to the console using `println!`.

```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

This simple Hello World program doesn't have any dependencies but you would add Rust package (crate) references under `[dependencies]`.

### Cargo build[#](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust#_cargo-build)

Cargo can be used to build your Rust project. Open a new VS Code [integrated terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) (Ctrl+Shift+\`) and type `cargo build`.

```
cargo build
```

You will now have `target\debug` folder with build output include an executable called `hello_world.exe`.





## Running Hello World

1. Cargo can also be used to run your Rust project via `cargo run`.

   ```
   cargo run
   ```

2. You can also run `hello_world.exe` manually in the terminal by typing `.\target\debug\hello_world`.
