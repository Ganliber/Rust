## Local Rust documentation

When you install Rust, you also get the full Rust documentation set locally installed on your machine, which you can review by typing `rustup doc`. The Rust documentation, including [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) and [The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/), will open in your local browser so you can continue your Rust journey while offline.
